### Algorithmic Trading Overview

Algorithmic trading means using computers to make investment decisions.  There are many types of algorithmic difference is their speed of executation of trades.

Python is the most popular programming language for algorithmic trading because it has alot of libraries, however it is slow.  To optimize the trading done with python we use libraries like NumPy to execute the functionality in C.

##### The Algorithmic Trading Process
The process of running a quantitative investing strategy can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Collect data
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy
3. Backtest that strategy
4. Implement that strategy in production (actually trading with real money)
